My personal notes for COMP 458: Quantum Computing Algorithms (Spring 25).

for working through and verifying the correctness of the algorithms with real code.

## Compiling the LaTeX with VimTex

1. Clone the repository:

```code
git clone https://github.com/micahkepe/comp458-notes.git
cd comp458-notes
```

2. Open the `main.tex` file in Vim or Neovim:

```
nvim main.tex
```

3. Ensure that you have the [`VimTeX`](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex) plugin
   installed. This will be used to compile the LaTeX files and preview the PDF in
   real-time in a PDF viewer of your choice (I use `sioyek`).

4. Compile the LaTeX file by running the following command in Vim:

   ```
   :VimTexCompile
   ```

5. Preview the compiled PDF:

   ```
   :VimTexView
   ```
