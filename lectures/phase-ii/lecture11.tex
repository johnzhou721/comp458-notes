\section{Lecture 11: Quantum Circuit Optimizations}\label{sec:lecture11}

The biggest sources of inefficiencies from the Grover's Search circuit that
we saw at the end of the last lecture were:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The way in which we implemented the multi-way OR gates.

  \item The extensive use of ancilla qubits.
\end{enumerate}

We will address both of these inefficiencies to get a shallower and simpler
circuit.

\subsubsection*{Converting from CNF to ANF}

In the last lecture, we wrote the clauses for the Alexandria ship problem using
conjunctive normal form (exclusively using OR and NOT for each clause). However,
by converting to using algebraic normal form (exclusively using AND and XOR), we
will only have to use $O(1)$ additional ancilla for this problem\footnote{It is
guaranteed that this conversion from CNF to ANF will produce similar results for
all problems.}, as opposed to the original $O(\text{# of clauses})$ addition
ancilla from the original CNF implementation.
